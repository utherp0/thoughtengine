 * The Mind is an object containing behaviours and settings, but no memory.
 * This is where the Meme actions are stored and applied, and impulsive responses
 * dealt with. This is the engine of the AI and is mutable without storing
 * long term information. The Mind is independent of the Cell, i.e. the Cell
 * contains the archetypes, statements and instances, along with contributor and 
 * perceived trusts. The Mind contains the code for altering the Cell *without*
 * human interaction and methods for changing the trust/completeness of the Cell.
